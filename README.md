# UAD Plugin Manager
UAD Plugin Manager is a simple tool used to manage Universal Audio DSP powered plugins. 

## Why?
When you install or upgrade the drivers for your Universal Audio interface, the installer reinstalls every plugins. Even if you don't own them. This makes browsing plugins in a DAW harder since you need to remember exactly which one you bought.

You could easily hide or remove the plugins by hand, but, with every update it becomes a time consuming task. This tool was created to simplify this process.
